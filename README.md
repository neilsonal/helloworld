# Hello World Webpage! 

As a GIS student new to programming, this repository has been set up for my first beginner project. 

## Project Description 

The objectives of this project are copied below as follows: 
- Create a GitHub repository to understand how version control works.
- Use GitHub Codespaces for editing and writing the HTML code for the webpage.
- Explore basic HTML and CSS to style the webpage.
- Publish the webpage using GitHub Pages to understand web hosting. 

## Files in the Repository 

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. 
- `README.md`: This file, providing details about the project and the learning process. 

## View the Webpage 

You can view the webpage I created at `https://neilsonal.github.io/helloworld/`.

## Questions or Issues 

If you have any questions about my project or encounter any issues, please open an issue in this repository, and I'll look into it as soon as possible. 

Thank you for checking out my first GitHub project!
